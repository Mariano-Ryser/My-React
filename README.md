# My portfolio with React 

This will be my personal Portfolio where I will be constantly updating and working on it.
Little by little I will add projects in which I have worked and in which I am currently working.

### `npm start`

Runs the portfolio in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
